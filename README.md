# React App using SpaceX GraphQL API
This react page pulls in data from the SpaceX GraphQL API. The GraphQL fields displayed concern different SpaceX missions with information on place/date of launch, rocket used, and an official SpaceX video of the launch. 

# Installation 
- run `git clone https://github.com/mattlee2021/spaceX_Launches_React.git`
- cd into spaceX_Launches_React
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start`

# Side Note
Sometimes you may have to refresh the page manually when changing the number of missions displayed on the webpage. You change the number of missions displayed by changing the number in the LaunchesContainer function to a non-negative integer.
